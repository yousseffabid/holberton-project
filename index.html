                            You might have heard it more than a thousand times in your life, but it’s very true!
                            A picture captures time, but not just time. It captures the moment, the emotion, and
                            everything
                            in
                            between.

                            Photography has always been a medium for informing, delighting and grabbing attention.
                            It showcases the beautiful side of the world as well as the ugly side.
                            It portrays everything without uttering a word.
                            It’s an art that can impact lives, and changes the course of history.

                            That’s why I love photography, and I would like to share my love with you for this art
                            through
                            this
                            website
                            that I created.

                            In order to understand the importance of photography and its contribution to culture, I will
                            share
                            with
                            you
                            the work of two world-renowned photographers: Steve McCurry, and Jimmy Nelson.
                            I will also talk about the different types of photography.
                            <br>
                            I hope reading about their work will get you inspired to take more pictures, and most
                            importantly
                            impact
                            the
                            world around you.

                        <p>The first photo picture—as we know it—was taken in 1825 by a French inventor Joseph Nicéphore
                            Niépce. It
                            records a view from the window at Le Gras.
                            Below is the first picture ever taken, for more info about the photographer click on the

                        <p>In 1900 the Kodak Brownie was introduced, becoming the first commercial camera in the market
                            available
                            for
                            middle-class buyers. The camera only took black and white shots, but still was very popular
                            due
                            to
                            its

                            commercially
                            viable

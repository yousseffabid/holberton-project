                        <P>There are many types of photography, each one has its own characteristics. Below you can find

                            <p>As a job, being a professional wedding photographer involves an exciting mix of
                                portraiture and
                                event photography in a wide variety of settings and groups. Wedding photography have to
                                be able to predict moments and direct others. They are quietly catching special moments,
                                yet all the while ensuring that they are not a distraction.

                            <p>
                                Portraiture is one of the most common types of photographer that we think of when we
                                consider
                                career
                                options. The kinds of photography that can be included in portraits is astounding.
                                A true portrait also portrays the personality of the subject. It tells a story about
                                their environment, their profession, their culture, or how theyâ€™re feeling in that
                                particular time and place.

                                Product photography is taking pictures using specific techniques to accurately and
                                attractively represent the product. Think about all of the
                                product you have recently shopped for: everything needs to be photographed. The
                                challenges of product photography are generally: To represent the product without
                                distortion, to represent the product in good lighting, with soft shadows and no
                                identifiable reflections
                            </p>

                                Of all of the types of photography, this is the one with no rules. Fine art
                                photographers create
                                art.
                                They display their work in galleries and at art shows, and generally, they sell a
                                finished,
                                framed
                                print
                                product to their customers. The camera is used to make an art piece that reveals the
                                vision of the artist and makes a statement of that vision rather than documenting the
                                subject before the lens.

                                Whether it be in war zones, political rallies, natural disasters, or community
                                celebrations,
                                photojournalists cover breaking news. While a journalist will use their pen and paper to
                                tell stories, a photojournalist will use their camera to capture the visual
                                representation of a story.

                            <p>
                                Landscape photography commonly involves photography of natural features of land, sky and
                                waters.
                                With a good landscape photo, the photographer wants to convey a certain feeling or mood
                                to the viewer. To accomplish this you need to use your creativity and composition
                                skills.
